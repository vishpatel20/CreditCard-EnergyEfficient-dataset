Credit Card fraud Detection and Energy Efficiency 

This is a machine learning project I did at Umass Lowell for my machine learning class in spring 2022. This project will describe how to implement
different machine learning algorithms such as random forest classification, neural network regressor and 4 others using two different datasets retrieved
from the Kaggle database.

Below I will list what is included in this git repo:

1) Python file for energy dataset 
2) Python file for credit card fraud detection
3) Dataset for energy efficiency
4) Link for credit card dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?select=creditcard.csv
5) Final report for my findings 

The results are very promising since I have achieve a very high accuracy for all six of my models and the report will go into detail as to what I did
exactly with each dataset. Credit card datset has a simple way of making a prediction for credit card fraud but the energy efficiency will go into detail
about heat maps and resampling data.
